We also used a package: in project directory, enter the command: <code>go get -u github.com/disintegration/imaging  </code>

We started off by creating GIFs from static images stored in our project directory. We used code from the following example:

We then created a static site, using the following tutorial:

This article helped us provide functionality for allowing users to upload files through the website:
